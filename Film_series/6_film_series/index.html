		<h4>King Corn</h4>
			<p>Tuesday, October 14, 2008</p>
			<p>6:30 – 9:00 PM</p>
			<p>Claire T. Carney Library Browsing Area</p>
			<p> Engrossing and eye-opening King Corn is a fun and crusading journey into the digestive tract of our fast food nation where one ultra-industrial pesticide-laden heavily-subsidized commodity dominates the food pyramid from top to bottom--corn. Fueled by curiosity and a dash of naiveté college buddies, Ian Cheney and Curt Ellis return to their ancestral home of Greene, Iowa to figure out how a modest kernel conquered America. With the help of some real farmers, oodles of fertilizer and government aid, and some genetically modified seeds the friends manage to grow one acre of corn. Along the way they unlock the hilarious absurdities and scary but hidden truths about America's modern food system.</p>
 
			<p>"A graceful and frequently humorous film that captures the idiosyncrasies of its characters and never hectors" (Salon), King Corn shows how and why whenever you eat a hamburger or drink a soda you're really consuming corn.</p>

			<p>An award winning documentary by Ricky Lake.</p>
 
			<p>Compelled to explore the subject after the delivery of her first child, actress Ricki Lake recruits filmmaker Abby Epstein to question the way American women have babies. Birth is a miracle, a rite of passage, a natural part of life. But birth is also big business. The film interlaces intimate birth stories with surprising historical, political and scientific insights and shocking statistics about the current maternity care system.</p>
			<p>When director Epstein discovers she is pregnant during the making of the film, the journey becomes even more personal. Should most births be viewed as a natural life process, or should every delivery be treated as a potentially catastrophic medical emergency?</p>

		<h4>The Great Global Warming Swindle</h4>
			<p>Wednesday, November 19, 2008 6:30 - 09:30 PM</p>
			<p>Claire T. Carney Library Browsing Area</p>
 
			<p>Everything you've ever been told about Global Warming is probably untrue. From Al Gore's “An Inconvenient Truth” to news reports from the popular media outlets and even public classrooms, which seem to be screaming, “the sky is falling!” But is it really? This film blows the whistle on what it claims is the biggest swindle in modern history. We are told that Man Made Global Warming is the biggest threat ever to mankind and that it may even threaten our very survival. If we do not change our ways and reduce CO2 emissions, polar ice caps will melt, coastal areas will flood and hurricanes like Katrina will become common. There is absolutely no room for doubt because there is a scientific consensus. Anyone who questions the data or conclusion is an enemy of the state and humanity.</p>
 
			<p>The Great Global Warming Swindle uses a plethora of leading scientists who will not bend to political or philosophical or ideological pressure. Watch this film and make up your own mind!</p>

		<h4>The Future of Food</h4>
			<p>Wednesday, February 4, 2009 6:30 - 09:30 PM  Claire T. Carney</p> 
			<p>Library Browsing Area</p>
			<p>There is a revolution happening in the farm fields and on the dinner tables of America - a revolution that is transforming the very nature of the food we eat.   This documentary offers an in-depth investigation into the disturbing truth behind the unlabeled, patented, genetically engineered foods that have quietly filled U.S. grocery store shelves for the past decade.   From the prairies of Saskatchewan, Canada to the fields of Oaxaca, Mexico, this film gives a voice to farmers whose lives and livelihoods have been negatively impacted by this new technology. The health implications, government policies and push towards globalization are all part of the reason why many people are alarmed by the introduction of genetically altered crops into our food supply.   The film examines the complex web of market and political forces that are changing what we eat as multinational corporations seek to control the world's food system. The film also explores alternatives to large-scale industrial agriculture, placing organic and sustainable agriculture as real solutions to the farm crisis today.   Sponsored by: Sustainability, MassPIRG & Social Change  A presentation and panel discussion will follow the film.</p>
			 
		<h4>Role Models</h4>
			<p>Monday, February 16, 2009 7:30 - 9:00 PM  Main Auditorium
			A pair of irresponsible energy drink salesmen realize that serving a month of hard time is nothing compared to spending 150 hours in a community mentorship program after they trash the company truck and find themselves at the mercy of the court in this comedy starring Seann William Scott and Paul Rudd. Wheeler (Scott) and Danny (Rudd) wouldn't necessarily be the first people a parent would turn to when seeking out a babysitter, in fact, they probably wouldn't even make the list in the first place. After slamming a few too many Minotaur energy drinks and crashing the company truck, however, the two loose-living pals narrowly avert jail when the court decides to let them become mentors to a group of young misfits. But how is the recently dumped Danny supposed to help bashful, role-playing geek Augie (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) become a man when all he can offer the boy is bitter sarcasm, and is beer-chugging man-child Wheeler really the best choice to help foul-mouthed fifth-grader Ronnie (Bobb’e J. Thompson) develop more respect for his elders? Probably not, but they'll have to do their best anyway when the center's ex-con director (Jan Lynch) confronts them with a harsh ultimatum. Now, if Wheeler and Danny can just make it through the rest of their probation without getting tossed in jail, maybe there's hope for the boys -- and Danny's relationship with his fed-up girlfriend (Elizabeth Banks) -- after all. ~ Jason Buchanan, All Movie Guide

		<h4>Why We Fight</h4>
			<p>Tuesday, March 3, 2009 6:30 - 9:30 PM  Claire T. Carney</p> 
			<p>Library Browsing Area</p>
			<p>Why We Fight is a film by Eugene Jarecki which won the Grand Jury Prize at the 2005 Sundance Film Festival. It is an unflinching look at the anatomy of the American war machine, weaving unforgettable personal stories with commentary by a "who's who" of military and beltway insiders. Featuring John McCain, William Kristol, Chalmers Johnson, Gore Vidal, Richard Perle and others, Why We Fight launches a bipartisan inquiry into the workings of the military industrial complex and the rise of the American Empire.   Inspired by Dwight Eisenhower's legendary farewell speech (in which he coined the phrase "military industrial complex"), filmmaker Jarecki surveys the scorched landscape of a half-century's military adventures, asking how--and telling why--a nation of, by, and for the people has become the savings-and-loan of a system whose survival depends on a state of constant war.   The film moves beyond the headlines of various American military operations to the deeper questions of why: why does America fight? What are the forces--political, economic, ideological--that drive us to fight against an ever-changing enemy?   "Frank Capra made a series of films during World War II called WHY WE FIGHT that explored America's reasons for entering the war," Jarecki notes. "Today, with our troops engaged in Iraq and elsewhere for reasons far less clear, I think it's crucial to ask the questions: 'Why are we doing what we are doing? What is it doing to others? And what is it doing to us?' "   Sponsored by: Sustainability, MassPIRG & Social Change  A panel discussion will follow the film. </p>

		<h4>Man on Wire</h4>
			<p>Wednesday, March 11, 2009 4:00 - 6:00 PM Liberal Arts, Room 104
			New York, August 7th, 1974. In what has been called "the artistic crime of the century," Philippe Petit, aided by some cohorts, strung a tightrope between the two World Trade Center towers and danced for nearly an hour. This was not the first time he had done such daring and controversial feats involving public trespassing and life-threatening displays, but it was his masterpiece, a caper and performance years in the making.   "Man on Wire" documents the caper from planning to heart-stopping execution, as well as the effects on Petit, his wife and his friends. It contains interviews with the people involved, which go beyond the event itself and into the relationships with a dynamic and driven person, and the effects such a relationship has on them.   Join the Philosophy Association for a screening of this movie followed by a discussion on artistic expression versus social contract, the limits of artistic creativity and expression, and the differences between living life to the fullest and being blinded with obsession. Other topics are also welcome.  Sponsored by: Philosophy Association  Free pizza and drinks provided.</p>

			<p>Award-winning film Kilowatt Ours: A Plan to Re-Energize America is a timely, solutions-oriented look at one of America's most pressing environmental challenges: energy.   Filmmaker Jeff Barrie offers hope as he turns the camera on himself and asks, "How can I make a difference?"
